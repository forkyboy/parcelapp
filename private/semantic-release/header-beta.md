## ðŸš§ This version is not ready for production use ðŸš§

This is the latest beta release of MyParcel PrestaShop v4.x. We've rewritten the entire module from scratch, using the [MyParcel Plugin Development Kit]. This module supports PrestaShop 8 and Php 7.2 through 8.2 (and onwards). See the [pinned issue] for more information on the changes.

For a less bug-prone experience, we recommend you use the stable or release candidate versions of the module instead. You can find the stable and release candidates in the [releases] section of this repository. The release candidates are versioned with a `-rc` suffix.

If you do choose to install this version, we would love to hear your feedback. Please report any issues you encounter using the [Bug report for v4.0.0-beta.x form] or by sending an email to [support@myparcel.nl]. Use in production is at your own risk.
